	<h1>Friday the 13th</h1>
	<p>It is now the day of Diana's workshop, approximately 10 people joined the course. Diana closes the door and begins to greet herself. She confirms with them that there is food and drinks available at anytime in order to use that energy towards creating robot arms. She now begins the session.</p>
